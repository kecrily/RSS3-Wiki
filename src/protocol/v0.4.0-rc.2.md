<!-- # RSS3 Protocol v0.4.0-rc.2 -->

## 1. Abstract

The right to create, disseminate and distribute information should not be in the hands of centralized governing. It is the basic right of cyber lives.

Gradually over the past two decades, several data superpowers have controlled contents and links to create a toxic centralized atmosphere, where privacy and freedom are sacrificed for profits. This atmosphere further hinders innovations: No matter how well you design and engineer your application, there is no way to compete with the data monopolies.

The world has been eager for a new way of information syndication. RSS used to be the pioneer of its time, now it’s time for us to pick up the baton and carry on.

Derived from the best out of RSS, RSS3 is an open information syndication protocol that aims to support efficient and decentralized information distribution in Web3. It defines the format of information presence and communication, with this elegantly designed, user-friendly content format, clients can easily access a variety of content sources in a uniform format without the need for extensive compatibility logic.

## 2. Status of This Document

This version is a beta version, although this protocol is well established in theory, it still needs to be tested in practice, so it is not guaranteed to be compatible with subsequent versions, but breaking updates will be kept to a minimum.

## 3. Dependencies

- [RFC 3986 - Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986): The protocol uses a large number of RFC 3986 Uniform Resource Identifiers to identify things in RSS3.
- [RFC 6838 - Media Type Specifications and Registration Procedures](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6838): The value of the item.attachment.mime_type field in the protocol uses the RFC 6838 standard.
- [JSON Schema: A Media Type for Describing JSON Documents](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-bhutton-json-schema-00): The protocol provides the user with a series of JSON Schema to do format validation.
- [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601): All times appearing in the protocol use the extended ISO 8601 format with 3 decimals (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ).

## 4. Main Concepts

### 4.1. Accounts

In order to remain open and compatible, the protocol does not create a new account system. Instead, it is compatible with existing account systems of other platforms, including accounts of cryptography-based decentralized and centralized platforms.

There are two types of accounts

- Main Account: the account in the instance URI, which represents the owner and signer of the file and can only be of a decentralized platform.

- Connected Accounts: accounts in the `profile.account` field, which represents other accounts belonging to the instance.

An account consists of two pieces of information: the account ID and the platform to which the account belongs.

```xsl
Account = <identity>@<account_platform>
```

- `identity` is the unique account ID within the platform;
- `account_platform` is defined by [RIP-1: Registered Account Platforms](./RIPs/RIP-1.md).

For example,

- An Ethereum account can be represented as `0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum`.

- A Twitter account can be represented as `DIYgod@twitter`.

### 4.2. Files

The RSS3 Network returns data and the user submits data in the form of RSS3-compliant JSON files.

The mime_type of RSS3 file is `application/rss3+json`, it is recommended to include `content-type: application/rss3+json; charset=utf-8` in the Response Headers of RSS3 file.

Each file has some basic properties.

```ts
type FileBase<URIType, ElementType> = {
    version: 'v0.4.0';
    date_updated: string;

    identifier: URIType;
    identifier_next?: URIType;

    total: number;
    list?: ElementType[];
}
```

#### 4.2.1. `version`

Version of the protocol, the current is `v0.4.0`.

#### 4.2.2. `date_updated`

The update time of the file, in the format of extended ISO 8601 with 3 decimals (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ).

#### 4.2.3. `identifier`

The protocol uses a number of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) that conform to the [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) standard to identify things in RSS3, such as instance identifiers, item identifiers, and list identifiers. The RSS3 URI can be used by users to access the items it represents or as the target of a link.

##### 4.2.3.1. Scheme

The scheme is `rss3`. I.e. RSS3 URI starts with `rss3://`.

##### 4.2.3.2. Authority

The protocol uses Instance as an authority.

An instance is an RSS3 interactive object and an RSS3 presence unit.

```xsl
Instance = <prefix>:<identity>@<platform>
```

- `prefix` is one constant of `account`, `asset`, `note`;
- `platform` is the platform to which the instance belongs. The platform of account is defined by [RIP-1: Registered Account Platforms](./RIPs/RIP-1.md), and the platform of item is defined by [RIP-3: Registered Item Networks](./RIPs/RIP-3.md) and [RIP-4: Registered Indexed Items](./RIPs/RIP-4.md);
- `identity` is the unique ID of the instance on this platform.

###### 4.2.3.2.1. Account Instance

An Account Instance is an Instance created with an account.

```xsl
AccountInstance = account:<account_identity>@<account_platform>
```

For example,

- `account:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum`
- `account:DIYgod@twitter`

###### 4.2.3.2.2. Item Instance

An Item Instance is an Instance for Item.

```xsl
ItemInstance = {asset|note}:<metadata_proof>@<item_network>
```

For example,

- `asset:0xacbe98efe2d4d103e221e04c76d7c55db15c8e89-5@ethereum`

##### 4.2.3.3. URI

The below illustrates the component of each URI.

###### 4.2.3.3.1. Instance URI

```xsl
InstanceURI = AccountInstanceURI | ItemInstanceURI

AccountInstanceURI = rss3://<AccountInstance>
ItemInstanceURI = rss3://<ItemInstance>
```

E.g.

- Account Instance URI

    ```text
    rss3://account:0xC8b960D09C0078c18Dcbe7eB9AB9d816BcCa8944@ethereum
    ```

- Asset Instance URI

    ```text
    rss3://asset:0xb9619cf4f875cdf0e3ce48b28a1c725bc4f6c0fb-1024@ethereum
    ```

- Note Instance URI

    ```text
    rss3://note:1483972580616949762@twitter
    ```

###### 4.2.3.3.2. Items URI

```xsl
ItemsURI = rss3://<Instance>/{notes|assets}[?<query_string>]
```

> Please refer to [Item](#_4-5-item) to know more.

Available queries:

    ```

##### 4.2.3.4. `identifier_next`

The URI used to identify the next page. If not specified, the current page is the last one by default.

For example:

```json
{
    "identifier":      "rss3://account:0xtest@ethereum/notes?limit=5",
    "identifier_next": "rss3://account:0xtest@ethereum/notes?limit=5&last_time=2022-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

#### 4.2.4. `total`

Total number of elements in this page and its next pages.

#### 4.2.5. `list`

List element, depending on the type of the list file, may be profile, item, link, backlink, etc.

### 4.3. Item

Item is an action or good that is automatically or passively generated by an instance. The protocol cannot predict what types of content there will be, so the protocol strives to define it more generically and unrestricted. It may be a blog post, an NFT, or a commodity, a game activity, etc.

#### 4.3.1. Item Types

##### 4.3.1.1. According to source

- Indexed Items: Items automatically indexed by the RSS3 Network from other networks or platforms based on the Main Account and Connected Accounts, as defined in [RIP-4: Registered Indexed Items](./RIPs/RIP-4.md).

- Custom Items: Items signed and submitted by user themselves.

##### 4.3.1.2. According to content

- Assets: They are the assets owned by instances, which can also be extended and interpreted as any fixed display content according to different usage scenarios, such as an NFT, a game achievement, a physical figure, a commodity for sale, etc.

- Notes: They are the actions or events generated by the instance, which can also be extended and interpreted as any stream content according to different usage scenarios, such as writing a blog post, getting a NFT dynamic, writing a forum post, posting a reply to other items, etc.

#### 4.3.2. Item Overall

The structure of Items could be seen in an index file:

```ts
type ItemsSet = {
    notes: {
        identifier_custom?: CustomItemListURI;
        identifier: AggregatedItemListURI;
        filters?: Filters;
    };
    assets: {
        identifier_custom?: CustomItemListURI;
        identifier: AggregatedItemListURI;
        filters?: Filters;
    };
};
```

##### 4.3.2.1. `items.assets`

`assets` are the items owned by instances, which can also be extended and interpreted as any fixed display content according to different usage scenarios, such as an NFT, a game achievement, a physical figure, a commodity for sale, etc.

##### 4.3.2.2. `items.notes`

`notes` are the actions or events generated by the instance, which can also be extended and interpreted as any stream content according to different usage scenarios, such as writing a blog post, getting a NFT dynamic, writing a forum post, posting a reply to other items, etc.

##### 4.3.2.3. `items.x.identifier_custom`

`identifier_custom` records the URI of the Custom Item list on the last page, and the list element is the item submitted by the user himself.

When there is only one page of content, the value of `identifier_custom` is `rss3://<Instance>/list/{note|asset}/0` till the content exceeds the file size limit specified by the RSS3 Network. Then the new item is recorded in a new file whose URI is `rss3://<Instance>/list/{note|asset}/1`, and the `identifier_custom` field is changed to `rss3://<Instance>/list/{note|asset}/1`.

##### 4.3.2.4. `items.x.identifier`

`identifier` is the URI of the aggregated item list, which contains both Custom Items and Indexed Items, sorted by `date_created`, the newest at the top. It supports some queries.

##### 4.3.2.5. `items.x.filters`

`filters` are used to filter the **Index Items** returned by `identifier` to meet the needs of the user's selective display.

It filters on `item.tags` and `item.metadata.network`.

```ts
type Filters = {
    blocklist?: string[];
    allowlist?: string[];
}
```

###### 4.3.2.5.1. `items.x.filters.blocklist`

Prevent items or backlinks containing fields in this list from being returned, e.g. `blocklist: ["twitter"]`, in which case, items with `item.tags` and `item.metadata.network` value of `twitter` will not be returned by AggregatedItemListURI.

###### 4.3.2.5.2. `items.x.filters.allowlist`

Only items or backlinks that contain fields in this list are allowed to be returned. If there is an allowlist, the blocklist will be invalid. For example, if `allowlist: ["twitter"]`, then only items with `item.tags` and `item.metadata.network` value of `twitter` will be returned by AggregatedItemListURI.

#### 4.3.3. Item Details

```ts
type Item = {
    identifier: ItemInstanceURI;
    date_created: string;
    date_updated: string;

    auto?: true;
    related_urls?: string[];

    links: LinksSet;

    tags?: string[];
    authors: Account[];
    title?: string;
    summary?: string;
    attachments?: Attachment[];

    metadata?: {
        network: NetworkName;
        proof: string;

        [key: string]?: any;
    };
};
```

##### 4.3.3.1. `item.date_created`

The time when the action or item was generated, in the format of ISO 8601, such as the time when the article was published, the time when the NFT was mint, the time when the product was put on the shelf, the time when the NFT was obtained (in the note, it indicates the time when the action was generated), etc.

##### 4.3.3.2. `item.date_updated`

The time of an action or item change, in the format of ISO 8601, such as article modification time, acquisition time of NFT (in the asset, indicating the time of the item change), etc.

##### 4.3.3.3. `item.auto`

If true, it means this is a Indexed Item rather than an Custom Item.

##### 4.3.3.4. `item.related_urls`

Only for Custom Items. URLs associated with the item, such as the address of the item in the indexed network.

##### 4.3.3.5. `item.identifier`

`identifier` is the uri of the item. See [Instance URI](#_4-4-3-1-instance-uri).

##### 4.3.3.6. `item.links`

See [Link](#_4-6-link).

##### 4.3.3.7. `item.tags`

`tags` is an array of strings. Similar to the concept of tags commonly used in personal blogs, you can add multiple tags to an article; the Indexed Items will also have tags, indicating the type of the item, and the specific value is limited in [RIP-4: Registered Indexed Items](./RIPs/RIP-4.md).

##### 4.3.3.8. `item.authors`

`authors` is an array of Accounts, indicating the accounts who have produced this item, such as the author of the article, the seller of the product, etc. It can be omitted if it is the current instance address.

If the item is an Indexed Item and the author is a Connected Account, it will additionally contain the Main Account.

##### 4.3.3.9. `item.title` and `item.summary`

The content of a `summary` cannot be too long, and the RSS3 Network should set a maximum length.

If it is a short content, then it is likely to only have a `summary` without a `title`, such as a Tweet from Twitter.

If it is a long article and its word count exceeds the size limit, then its `summary` should only be a summary or truncation of the article, and the complete content should be placed in `attachments`.

##### 4.3.3.10. `item.attachments`

`attachments` records the attachments of this item, such as images of the article, etc. If it is a long article, it may also contain the full text of the article.

It is an array of attachment. Each element's structure is:

```ts
type Attachment = {
    type?: string;
    content?: string;
    address?: URI;
    mime_type: string;
    size_in_bytes?: number;
}
```

###### 4.3.3.10.1. `item.attachments[i].type`

The type of attachment, indicating the function or classification of this attachment, such as thumbnail, detailed description, etc.

This value can be any string.

###### 4.3.3.10.2. `item.attachments[i].content` and `item.attachments[i].address`

`content` is the actual content of the attachment, such as the full body of the article or the base64 string of an image. The content of this field may be very long, but the RSS3 Network should also be limited to the maximum length of the content to avoid affecting the storage efficiency of the entire network. Content that exceeds the maximum length limit should be placed in the address field using third-party storage.

`address` is the URI of this attachment pointing to a third-party address, such as a markdown file address or an image address.

`content` and `address` are mutually exclusive, one attachment can only have one and only one of them.

###### 4.3.3.10.3. `item.attachments[i].mime_type`

This records the media type of this attachment. The format must conform to the RFC 6838 standard, such as `image/png`, `text/markdown`, etc. This is an important but easily overlooked field from an application presentation point of view, so the protocol specifies it as a required field.

###### 4.3.3.10.4. `item.attachments[i].size_in_bytes`

This records the size of this attachment in bytes. It is useful for displaying large files such as videos and audios. It is also a field that is easily overlooked. The protocol recommends that the existence and accuracy of this field be ensured as much as possible.

##### 4.3.3.11. `item.metadata`

This records metadata for Indexed Items, with specific values defined in [RIP-4: Registered Indexed Items](./RIPs/RIP-4.md).

###### 4.3.3.11.1. `item.metadata.network`

The network where this item is stored.

Its value is defined by [RIP-3: Registered Item Networks](./RIPs/RIP-3.md).

###### 4.3.3.11.2. `item.metadata.proof`

This records the credentials for indexing this Indexed Item, such as transaction hash and the address of a centralized platform.

### 4.4. Link

This describes the relationship between two instances or items in RSS3.

#### 4.4.1. Item Types

- Indexed Links: Links automatically indexed by the RSS3 Network from other networks or platforms based on the Main Account and Connected Accounts.

- Custom Links: Links signed and submitted by user themselves or automatically indexed by the Index Item Instance.

#### 4.4.2. Link Overall

Link exists in two places, Instance and Item, both of which have a `links` field. In the content:

```ts
interface LinksSet {
    identifiers?: {
        type: LinkType;
        identifier_custom: CustomLinkListURI;
        identifier: AggregatedLinkListURI;
    }[];
    identifier_back: BacklinkListURI;
}
```

##### 4.4.2.1. `links.identifiers.type`

The type of relationship, such as the following relationship of Instance, the comment relationship of Item, etc. The specific value is restricted in [RIP-5: Registered Link Types](./RIPs/RIP-5.md).

##### 4.4.2.2. `links.identifiers.identifier_custom`

This records the URI of the Custom Link list on the last page.

When there is only one page of content, the value of `identifier_custom` is `rss3://<Instance>/list/link/0`, until the content exceeds the file size limit specified by the RSS3 Network, then the new link is recorded in a new file whose URI is `rss3://<Instance>/list/link/1`, and changes the `identifier_custom` field to `rss3://<Instance>/list/link/1`.

##### 4.4.2.3. `links.identifiers.identifier`

This is the URI of the aggregated link list, which supports some queries.

##### 4.4.2.4. `links.identifier_back`

This records the reverse relationship of this link. For example, if A records a following relationship to B, then the `identifier_back` of B will automatically record a reverse-following (i.e., followed-by) relationship of A.

#### 4.4.3. Link Details

```ts
type Link = {
    identifier_target: InstanceURI;
    type: LinkType;

    auto?: true;
    metadata?: Metadata;
};
```

##### 4.4.3.1. `link.identifier_target`

The link target is an RSS3 URI, which can be an Instance URI or an Item URI. It means that the user can follow an RSS3 account, and comments on an RSS3 asset or an RSS3 note.

##### 4.4.3.2. `link.type`

See [links.identifier_back](#_4-6-2-4-links-identifier-back).

### 4.5. Profile

Profile is located in the `profile` field of an Index File, which records the basic information of the instance, including the name, avatar, profile, etc.

```ts
type Profile = {
    name?: string;
    avatars?: URI[];
    bio?: string;
    attachments?: Attachment[];

    accounts?: Accounts;

    tags?: string[];
    metadata?: Metadata;
};
```

#### 4.5.1. `profile.name`

The name of the instance, such as the user's screen name, the asset's title.

#### 4.5.2. `profile.avatars`

Instance icons, such as the user's avatar and asset images, can be set multiple at the same time, and applications should generally choose the first to display.

#### 4.5.3. `profile.bio`

Textual introduction to the instance.

#### 4.5.4. `profile.attachments`

When used for Item Instance, same as [item.attachments](#_4-5-3-10-item-attachments).

When used for Account Instance, `profile` is a very flexible and diverse information. The protocol cannot predict all requirements, so only a few of the most commonly used information are defined, and it is expected to use the `attachments` field to record the profile information that is not clearly defined, such as `websites`, `banner`.

For example:

```json
{
    "attachments": [
        {
            "type": "websites",
            "content": "https://rss3.io\nhttps://diygod.me",
            "mime_type": "text/uri-list",
        },
        {
            "type": "banner",
            "content": "ipfs://QmT1zZNHvXxdTzHesfEdvFjMPvw536Ltbup7B4ijGVib7t",
            "mime_type": "image/jpeg",
        }
    ]
}
```

#### 4.5.5. `profile.accounts`

This is the other [accounts](#_4-2-account) used to record instance bindings, including accounts of cryptography-based decentralized and centralized platforms.

```ts
type Accounts = {
    identifier: AccountInstanceURI;
    signature?: string;
}[];
```

##### 4.5.5.1. `profile.accounts[i].identifier`

The URI of the account. If it is a decentralized account based on cryptography, use `profile.accounts[i].signature` to verify ownership. If it is a centralized account that cannot be signed, the user must put the address or name (Refer to [RIP-2: Registered Name Services](./RIPs/RIP-2.md)) of the Main Account into some location in the platform's account configuration to verify ownership, as specified by [RIP-1: Registered Account Platforms](./RIPs/RIP-1.md).

#### 4.5.6. `profile.accounts[i].signature`

This is used to verify the ownership of the bound account, signed by the bound account instead of the Main Account.

```ts
profile.accounts[i].signature = sign(`[RSS3] I am adding account ${profile.accounts[i].identifier} to my RSS3 Instance ${InstanceURI}`);
```

#### 4.5.7. `profile.tags` and `profile.metadata`

For Item Instance, same as [item.tags](#_4-5-3-7-item-tags) and [item.metadata](#_4-5-3-11-item-metadata).
